                    |Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
                    |An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) 
                    |and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.
                    |The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884,but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, 
                    |the number hit being scored"."Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. 
                    |The US renaming of "noughts and crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.
                    |In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge,
                    | became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.
                    |In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. 
                    |The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the 
                    |Computer History Museum.
